## ChessDiag

Amazing and easy chess diagrams makers. It is a simple website to create chess diag.
ChessDiag is used to optimize the creation of chess diags in order to put it in a word file in A4 format.

I use this amazing chess library http://chessboardjs.com/ in order to get these following goals: 
* Create easily and efficiently chess diag
* The interface should be efficient with a minimum of buttons
* Give the availibility to download it as .fen format or an image (png or bitmatp) (easy to download and save it in any folder of the user)
* As an image, the user can should three different sizes (6x6; 4.7x4.7; 3.5x3.5 in cm)
* As an image, 3 modes are available: Economic (less black as possible), classic (black and white) and color.
